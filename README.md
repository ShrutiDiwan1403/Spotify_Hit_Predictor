# Spotify_Hit_Predictor
**Objective Summary**: Labouring with the Spotify dataset is to predict a hit song using different soundtrack feature.The other sub-objective is to improve the research of musicologists employing exploratory and predictive analysis. Simultaneously enhance the creativity of the music virtuoso.

*Energy Dashboard*

*Target Audience and decision-making process*: The prime beneficiary of this layout will be the artists themselves, music composers, and listeners. First, the performer/singer will recognize the key and genre they are more comfortable with while creating the melody. What is their liveness when they sing a song with a particular key? Finally, they can ascertain their energy range. And work on improving it if required. Listeners can pick songs and artists depending upon the energy range they favour. They can also consider the genre. The layout will work as a blueprint for the music composers can work on developing music after understanding the energy range of the artist. They 
can also unveil the energy trend in different decades before releasing their work. Since energy is the sense of forwarding motion in music, whatever keeps the listener engaged and listening. Composers can write and arrange music for various media, including film, tv, stage 
productions, video games, and advertisements, as per the energy requirement in that scenario. 


*Purpose*: The intent here is to find the liveness of the melody for all the musical keys. The other aspiration is to find the relationship of energy feature with other remaining features of the songs. 


*Information it presents*: The dashboard exhibits the maximum energy for the different genres for each decade. While the track's energy is found based on the two attributes. At the same time, the summation of energy of all the ways for all the artists can be noted, which is segregated by decade. Both leading and featuring artists are exerted to unveil the total energy here. Suppose only the leading artist attribute is considered. In that case, the energy value of the main artist who also appeared as a featuring artist will get factored out from the closing value. And affect the overall result. Finally, the liveness of tracks by 12 musical keys for each decade can also be seen. Maximum energy is used instead of minimum energy in the first chart. When the graph was formed using the min value, the range was assigned to infer the musical piece with minimum energy. It was noticed that many artists have a high energy range while recording a track. And so, the maximum function was added to set out better results. 


*Actionable Insights*: When the dashboard is filtered by the 'Energy of Artist' graph that is any jitter (each jitter represents a distinct artist from that era), then the maximum energy of the artist for all the genres they have sung the song in is displayed. The liveness of all the keys for different decades for all the tracks sang by a particular artist is exhibited.
